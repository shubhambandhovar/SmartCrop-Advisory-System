Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation (k=5) Results
----------------------------------------------
Model: Random Forest Classifier
Explanation: Stratification ensures that each fold maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset. This is critical for imbalanced agricultural data to prevent folds that might lack certain rare crop instances.

Fold Accuracies: [1.0, 0.9972, 0.9886, 0.9886, 0.9943]
Mean Accuracy: 0.9938
Standard Deviation: 0.0045
